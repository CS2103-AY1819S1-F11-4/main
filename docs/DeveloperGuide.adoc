By: `Team F11-4`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later.
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AppChangedEvent` when the NUS Hangs Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete_friend 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the NUS Hangs Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Erium data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.Erium.commons` package.


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Timetable Feature

==== Reason for implementation
The objective of the `add_timetable` feature is to to add data entries of a timetable into NUS Hangs. But it is hard to visualise the adding of the entries so we allowed user to add directly all the entries from a csv file. For `edit_timetable` , it is for User who just want to edit entries without going to find the timetable. For `download_timetable`, it is to allow the user to share their timetable to their friends.

==== How to implement
For `add_timetable` , we create a `timetable` class in `person` first, then we create a `timetableData` class with method to create a String [][] Matrix from the data from the csv file. Then we create a timetableString to which contains information on the entries about the `timetable` and store it in the xml file of the person in the addressbook.

==== Current Implementation

The current `timetable` commands are:

* `add_timetable` -- adds a timetable from the csv file to the person.
* `delete_timetable` -- delete a timetable from the person and creates a default timetable in person. It will also find the timetable csv file of the person and deletes it.
* `edit_timetable` -- edit a timetable timeslot in the person
* `download_timetable` -- downloads a timetable into a csv file into a stored folder location from the person.

These operations are handled by the `logic` component and uses the `person` in `model` to do the execution.

Given below is an activity diagram.

image::timetableworkflow.png[width="500"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add_timetable` behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time. The NUS Hangs will initialise the person with the timetable with the details which was stored using Storage.

Step 2:  user finds a timetable of first `person` in the stored location which is called 495011161 timetable.csv. Using this command, User does not need to find the timetable. As shown in the diagram below its easy to see what event the person has.

image::addTimetable-step-2.png[width="500"]

Step 3: The user executes `add_timetable 1` to add the timetable of first `person` in stored folder to NUS hangs. A new `timetable` will be created containing the data of the `timetable` of first `person` in stored folder. The `timetable` of first `person` will be replaced by this new `timetable`.

The `timetable` is then added to storage as a String which contains all of the data. This is to allow the app to save time in storage.


The following sequence diagram shows how `add_timetable` works.

image::addtimetablediagram.png[width="500"]

==== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 :** adds the timetable via a csv file.
** Pros: Easier for user to visualise and edit his timetable
** Cons: Hard to implement. No choice other than to edit his timetable from the stored folder defined.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice) :** adds the timetable via a csv file from other locations.
** Pros: Easier for user to visualise and edit his timetable and allows user a choice on where to edit his timetable.
** Cons: Hard to implement, and user has to know how to get file location of a file.
* **Alternative 3:** User knows how to edit via the xml file of the person.
** Pros: Easier to implement
** Cons: User must know how to edit via the xml file of the person, and harder for User to visualise.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the add_timetable commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a String [][] Matrix to store entries of the timetable.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. Better intuition to access entries of the matrix (matrix[i][j]) Which makes `edit_timetable` easier to implement.
** Cons: Slower Time efficiency because using 2 for loops to fill the Matrix with the data. Unable to use functions in ArrayList.
* **Alternative 2:** Use ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>
** Pros: Faster Time efficiency because using 1 for loops to fill the Matrix with the data. Able to use functions in ArrayList
** Cons: Harder for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. Less intuition to access entries of the matrix (matrix.get(i).get(j)).

=== Security Mechanism

The main objectives of the security mechanism includes:

* Preventing unauthorised usage of the application
* Preventing unauthorised access and editing rights to the data stored within the application

The following activity diagram illustrates how the workflow is restricted through the security mechanism.

.Activity Diagram of Security Mechanism
image::SecurityMechanismActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]


To prevent unauthorised access (read, edit and other commands) of application users are required to login to the application. Each users would only be able to access data created by themselves or data which they have been granted rights to access.

To meet this end, various functions are implemented.


==== Current Implementation


*Account Creation and Login* [implemented in v1.1, incomplete]

The first step in securing the system is to restrict access to unauthorised users. This is accomplished by setting up `create` and `login` functions.

- `create`: creates an account
- `login`: login to account

Both functions are handled by the logic component, make use of the model component and is eventually managed through the storage component.

The username is stored as a key in a hashmap while the password is encrypted and stored as the value. By using a hashmap to store the account login credentials, it becomes easy to implement the create and login function.

.Sequence Diagram of Create Command
image::CreateCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


.Sequence Diagram of Login Command
image::LoginCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

*To be implemented: *

convert hashmap storage into XML and vice-versa

*Password Encryption* [implemented in v1.2, to be improved]

To prevent unauthorised users from getting the password by looking at the .xml files, the password is encrypted before storage. This is done by implementing Java Cryptography module.


*Login Status Check* [to be implemented in v1.3]

Next, there is a need to check if user is logged in before executing any entered commands. This is done by implementing a check function in the AddressBookParser.



Step 1: A new user launches the application for the first time. The welcome page would prompt the user to create an account and refer to `help` function for more details.

[LeslieTODO: to be updated - add image]
image::SecurityMechanism-Step01-Diagram.png[width="300"]

Step 2: The user follows the prompt to create an account, supplying a username and password.
[LeslieTODO: to be updated - add image]
image::SecurityMechanism-Step02-Diagram.png[width="300"]

Step 2a: The user supplies a duplicate username and is prompted to choose another.
[LeslieTODO: to be updated - add image]
image::SecurityMechanism-Step02a-Diagram.png[width="300"]

Step 2b: The user supplies a unique username and the account is successfully created.
[LeslieTODO: to be updated - add image]
image::SecurityMechanism-Step02b-Diagram.png[width="300"]

Step 3: The user is prompted to login.
[LeslieTODO: to be updated - add image]
image::SecurityMechanism-Step03-Diagram.png[width="300"]

Step 3a: The user supplies the wrong login credentials.
[LeslieTODO: to be updated - add image]
image::SecurityMechanism-Step03a-Diagram.png[width="300"]

Step 3b: The user supplies the right login credentials.
[LeslieTODO: to be updated - add image]
image::SecurityMechanism-Step03b-Diagram.png[width="300"]

Step 4: The user now have access to most of the commands.
[LeslieTODO: to be updated - add image]
image::SecurityMechanism-Step04-Diagram.png[width="300"]

In version 1.1, the implementation is up to step 3b.
In version 1.2, the user password is encrypted to prevent loss of password.
In version 1.3, step 4 would be implemented.

In version 2.0, encryption would be extended to other essential data stored within the system.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Create and Login

*Alternative 1 (current choice):* create stores data in a hashmap.

Pros:

- hashmap does not allows duplicate keys, making it easy to implement

Cons:

- [LeslieTODO: to be updated]

*Alternative 2:*

Pros:

- [LeslieTODO: to be updated]

Cons:

- [LeslieTODO: to be updated]


[LeslieTODO: to be updated: ]

===== Aspect: How encryption executes

*Alternative 1 (current choice):* a function call to encryption before storing password data into hashmap. when logging in, a function call encrypts the user entered password before comparing to stored password in hashmap

Pros:

- hashmap does not allows duplicate keys, making it easy to implement

Cons:

- [LeslieTODO: to be updated]

=== Group Feature

The `Group` class extends the `Entity` abstract class just like a `Person` class does. An `Entity` contains an abstract method `isSame` that is necessary for the class to be used in `UniqueList<T extends Entity>`. `Group` class is an immutable class that is contained inside `Model`.

`Group` features make use of `Storage` to load information on groups added by the user before the UI is closed. `XmlAdaptedGroup` class helps the convert groups detail from xml files to the `AddressBook` when `MainApp` starts and similarly convert `Group` objects into xml files.

`Group` features also updates the Group Panel inside the `UI` using a predicate.

[MelodiesTODO: Add diagram showing how Group class interacts with Storage, UI, Model and Logic]

==== Current Implementation
The current group commands added are:

* `add_group` -- adds a group with an optional description
* `delete_group` -- deletes a group and all references from its members to it
* `edit_group` -- edit name/description of a group, maintaining uniqueness in group names
* `find_group` -- search for groups using keywords that must match exactly a word in Group name (TODO v1.4: Edit to find_group keyword matches substring of a word in group name or description)
* `register` -- register a member into an existing group and include a reference to the group in the member (Person class)
* `delete_member` -- delete an existing member from an existing group and remove reference to that group in the member
* `view_group` -- view the existing members in the group and is updated whenever any member is added or deleted.
* `list [index]` -- lists all the groups the person at [index] is currently in.

These functions and their parsers are handled in `Logic`, makes use of and updates `Model` and `Storage` and displaying the updated result on the `UI`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `register` behaves at each stop.

Step 1: The user launches the application. (Assuming that the user has already added a group and person.) `VersionedAddressBook` will be loaded with the final addressbook state before the application is closed. Lists of groups and persons added previously will be loaded from storage xml file into `Model` using `XmlAdaptedPerson` and `XmlAdaptedGroup` classes. The updated lists will be displayed in the `UI`.

Step 2:The user enters the index of the person and name of the group he wants to add the person into. `RegisterParser` creates a new `RegisterCommand` object with the Person and Group that is involved which checks whether the person and group already exist (else throwing `CommandException`).

Step 3: `RegisterCommand` adds the person as a member in the group and adds a reference to the group inside the person's `List<Group>`. Since `Group` and `Person` are immutable classes, a new object has to be created in this step.

Step 4: `Model` is updated of the new `Group` and `Person`. `FilteredPersonList` and `FilteredGroupList` is also updated to display the new groups and persons in the `UI`. A successful message is also displayed to the user below the UI's command box.
[MelodiesTODO: Elaborate on how connection to UI is created.]

.Sequence Diagram of RegisterCommand (Model component)
image::RegisterCommandModelSequenceDiagram.png[width="750"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to implement `Group` class

*Alternative 1 (current choice):* `Group` as an immutable class.

Pros: Immutable objects are good Map keys and Set elements, since these typically do not change once created. Immutability makes it easier to write, use and reason about the code.

Cons: Doing so might restrict the way one can call the class and its methods. It may be slower as you have to create new objects with every command.

*Alternative 2:* Setter methods for Groups

Pros: Easier and less code for methods involving groups. Faster as do not have to create new objects each time you change a Group (e.g. edit its description or group members).

Cons: Miss out on the advantages of immutable object (above). Good practice to use immutable objects.

===== Aspect: Interactions between person and groups

Deleting a person from a group will affect the person's reference to that group and vice versa (similar for adding and editing).

*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Having a `UniqueList<Groups>` in `Person` and `UniqueList<Person>` in `Group`.

Pros: Easy to retrieve groups from Person and persons from Group. Existing `UniqueList` class available (since already used in `Model`).

Cons: Have to update both lists in most group commands (e.g. registering a new member in a group). Issue of enforcing referential integrity - defensive programming.

*Alternative 2* Just update the list of groups in `Model` and have person refer to that list of group as to whether it is a member of the group.

Pros: Less issues with enforcing referential integrity (see alternative 1).

Cons: Can be more expensive to look for groups for a particular person.

=== Person Feature

The 'Person' class extends the `Entity` abstract class and it is contained within 'Model'.

'Person' feature make use of 'Timetable' and 'Group' class to assign respective information to each instance of a person.

==== Current Implementation

The current person implementation are:

* 'add' -- add any person with the choice of adding address, phone, email and tags
* 'find' -- finds all persons in NusHangs, whose contain keywords provided by prefix(es)

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the execute("find n/alex") API call.

image::FindSequence.png[width="600"]

The following activity diagram shows how 'find' feature works:

image::FindFeature1.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How should each specific 'find' feature work

*Alternative 1 (Current Choice) :* Use prefixes for specific search (e.g. find n/alex bernice t/friends)

Pros: Higher flexibility. Greater control of search range

Cons: Harder to implement

*Alternative 2 :* Create a class for each information (e.g. find_address)

Pros: Easy to implement, with specific search focus

Cons: Repetitive code base with less flexibility

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

eryone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.


[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:
.We target:
. Small to medium scale interest groups in NUS
. Groups who find organising a common / least conflicted dtime slot to meet a hassle

*Value proposition*:
Automate the process of organising meetings and finding least conflicted time slot for the group in a way faster than manually checking everyone's timetables.
